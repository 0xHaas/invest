It's been a hectic few weeks, to say the very least.

I haven't written anywhere near as much as I'd hoped over the past month, but I've been productive in a number of other ways, including (and especially) updating this site. Beyond this, initial setup of my new computer has taken up the majority of my time -- transplanting three years of keybindings was surprisingly more of an undertaking than I initially thought.

While it's not perfect, the new blog possesses a number of improvements I've been looking for -- allowing me to quickly update content on my non-blog pages, having in-line code, and allowing easy hyperlinking throughout.

## Reading

I've only read a tiny amount recently, mostly focusing on furthering myself as a senior engineer. I've found that the [Google Design Doc](https://www.industrialempathy.com/posts/design-doc-a-design-doc/) has been incredibly helpful for this -- having the ability to present documentation to communicate expectations, constraints, and overall timelines has been useful.

## Setup

As mentioned, I've spent most of my time recently setting up my computer. I highly recommend checking out [uses](/uses) for details on the setup. I inherited many aspects of the setup from [Nikita](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/), who has an absolutely superb breakdown of various components of his setup.
