Stuff that I like and use regularly. No affiliate links.

## Hardware

**Computer**: I have a number of computers I perform daily work on, but a majority of my time is spent on my MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2020, Four Thunderbolt 3 ports).

I've maxed it out in terms of both RAM and processor speed, allowing me to zip through the many software applications I run. My work computer has near identical components, but it is 16 inches rather than 13.

**Phone**: iPhone 11 Pro running iOS 14. I try to avoid installing anything more than I need on my phone, and have notifications turned off for almost all applications.

**Watch**: Series 5 Apple Watch. I've gotten used to having notifications on my wrist for a number of years. Having the ability to quickly get updates on my life for me is pivotal.

**Yubikey**: MFA everywhere, and MFA often. I use multiple Yubikeys depending upon the service I am trying to authenticate into, but I tend towards using the newer USB-C keys that remain mostly flush with the host.

**Oura Ring**: I track pretty much everything. Oura lets me know whether or not I am meeting my goals (sleep, exercise, HRV) and how to improve any deviations that do exist.

**Eight Sleep**: Same as above. This bed is a lifesaver. Having the ability to set bed temperature and tracking on both sides of the bed has been incredible.

**Peloton**: Spin classes have been incredible for my overall health. Peloton has a number of modes which allow simply clipping in and immediately getting a work out. I try to get at least a half hour in every day. If you'd like to add me, ping me on Twitter.

**AirPods Pro**: The gold standard in "I need to be able to listen to things" / "I need to do phone calls" / "I just need headphones that work." I am rarely (if ever) seen without them.


## Software

[NeoVim](https://neovim.io/) is my primary editor in the terminal. I've used Vim for years, but having expanded plugins and bindings has heavily sped up my flow.

[iterm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) is my terminal of choice. It just works.

[Reeder](https://www.reederapp.com) is my read it later app. Complete iCloud sync is the reason I use it, since it is lacking on features compared to Instapaper and Pocket (no tagging, folders or search).

[Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) gets me access to everything I need quickly. I use a number of powerpacks in order to streamline additional searches and actions -- network utilities, GitHub pull requests, and so on.

[CommandE](https://getcommande.com/) is my Alfred in the cloud. Anything I need access to, whether it be a GitHub commit, a Salesforce contact, or a Google Doc -- it's all there.

[2Do](https://www.2doapp.com/) is how I track what I need to get done. I've used a number of alternatives, but 2Do allows me to create the most extensive and detailed to-do items.

[Bartender](https://www.macbartender.com/) allows for me to clean up my menu bar. As I run a number of items in parallel, this overall makes things far more clean.

[Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash) is the documentation browser I've found most useful. It's great to be able to gain a quick understanding of what values I should send in and gather information from.

[BetterTouchTool](https://folivora.ai/) is my way of adding super powers to my touch pad. It's a way of quickly pulling up applications and items I use daily.

[Hopper](https://www.hopperapp.com/) is my primary disassembler. IDA is incredible, but awfully expensive -- having the ability to quickly (and cheaply) take interesting binaries apart has been unparalleled.

[IINA](https://iina.io/) is my media viewer. QuickTime is great, but having the ability to have subtitles, playback history, and many other items I don't traditionally have through QuickTime is incredible.

[Karabiner](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) allows for me to bind my keys to [pretty much everything](https://medium.com/@nikitavoloboev/karabiner-god-mode-7407a5ddc8f6)

[Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/) is quite similar -- I use [Nikita's bindings](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/macos/macos-apps/keyboard-maestro/km-macros)

[Mighty](https://mightyapp.com) is my primary browser. It's incredibly fast, has an absurdly low memory footprint, and simply just works.

[Notion](https://notion.so) is my note taking utility. It's still a bit heavy for my purposes, so I'm open to alternatives.

[Popclip](https://pilotmoon.com/popclip/) brings iOS style highlighting options to macOS. I have found it to be incredibly useful for actions I perform every day (adding things to notes or calendar) and quickly gaining context on an item.

[Superhuman](https://superhuman.com) is my email client of choice. I was one of the first 100 users, and I have no plan of stopping. Superhuman is one of the few reasons I can achieve inbox zero. I have a significant amount of configuration changes within Superhuman that allow me to quickly triage inbound emails and respond / file accordingly.

[Timing](https://timingapp.com/?lang=en) allows me to track my time expenditure. It's been incredibly useful in determining how and where I'm unproductive.

[Tweetbot](https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/mac/) is my Twitter client of choice. Twitter removed a number of pieces of functionality, it's still incredibly useful.

[Typinator](https://www.ergonis.com/products/typinator/) provides immense value in quickly fixing typos and expanding content for my frequently typed messages.

[Typora](https://typora.io/) is where I write my markdown. It's clean, streamlined, and allows me to quickly produce new content.

[Clean.email](https://clean.email/) is one of the few ways I sort through my mail. I receive thousands of pieces of mail a year, so being able to know that only the items in my inbox are high priority has been amazing.
