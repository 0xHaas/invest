We tend to invest via syndicates, but happily invest via other mediums if it's a good fit. Most of our investments are things that make us or our friends more productive, so if you're building something in this space, let us know.

Some of our more recent investments include:
- [Atoms](https://atoms.com)
- [CommandE](https://getcommande.com)
- [Haus](https://drink.haus/)

We advise a few companies, and invest our time and money where we can provide the greatest benefit.
