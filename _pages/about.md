Hi, I'm Jonathan Haas, a security and privacy engineer based in San Francisco. I work on a variety of scalable security systems, and design with privacy first principles.

I invest in startups via [Haas Capital](https://haas.capital). I tend to invest via syndicates, but I happily invest via other mediums if it's a good fit. Most of my investments are things that make myself and others more productive, so if you're building something in this space, let me know.

Some of my more recent investments include:
- [Atoms](https://atoms.com)
- [CommandE](https://getcommande.com)
- [Haus](https://drink.haus/)

I advise a few companies, and invest my time and money where I can provide the greatest benefit.
