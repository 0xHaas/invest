I'm a security and privacy engineer based in San Francisco. I work on a variety of scalable security systems, and design with privacy first principles.

I invest in startups via [Haas Capital](https://haas.capital). I tend to invest via syndicates, but I happily invest via other mediums if it's a good fit. Most of my investments are things that make myself and others more productive, so if you're building something in this space, let me know.

Some of my more recent investments include:
- [Atoms](https://atoms.com)
- [CommandE](https://getcommande.com)
- [Haus](https://drink.haus/)

I advise a few companies, and invest my time and money where I can provide the greatest benefit.

I'm very into [productivity](/productivity) and I take numerous steps to streamline my work. Most of what I do regularly has been automated in some form (or is in the process of being so).

I love chatting with people on the internet with similar niche interests. Please send me an email at {{ site.email }} if this describes you.

If you insist on being official, there's always [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanahaas/).
