Itâ€™s a constant struggle to stay informed and discover new ideas without information overload.

Following a few good blogs and podcasts gives me a far better view than chasing up-to-the-second headlines.

## Blogosphere

[Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net) has tech news, politics and random tidbits.

[Uses This](https://usesthis.com/) has an interview-style breakdown of the software, hardware, and procedures people use. I read each new post that comes in.

## Podcasts

I've yet to find a podcast I feel gives the right yield per hours/minutes invested. If you've got any ideas, I'd love to hear them.

## Twitter

I use Twitter most heavily for quick information gathering and interacting with my friends. I generally don't post or consume any longform content here. I usually try to keep my feed as little as possible.

[@thegrugq](https://twitter.com/thegrugq) for unique OSINT takes.

[@vcbrags](https://twitter.com/vcbrags) to keep some humor pertaining to the newest silicon valley hotness.

[@matthew_d_green](https://twitter.com/matthew_d_green) for all things cryptography related.
