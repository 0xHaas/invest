I write about things I find interesting. I intend to extract no monetary value from this site, so there are minimal pushes for SEO, and you should see no ads.

## Technical details

I use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) to build a static site that's served over [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).

Check out my [source code](https://github.com/JonHaas/blog) for more information on how that is performed. If you navigated to my [root domain](https://jonathanha.as), you were redirected here through a combination of CloudFront and S3.

The site includes minimal JavaScript, as understandably some individuals do not wish to enable it -- that noted, certain functionality on the site requires it, so if you're seeing various page breaks, that may be why.

## Typography

If you're on an Apple device, you're seeing Iowan Old Style. Most other devices should get Palatino, and an unlucky few are stuck with their default serif font.
